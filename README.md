# nounou
##How it works:
When a user(parent) needs a playdate for their child/children, they can use this application in finding other parents who may be hosting the playdates. This application is for children but steered by their parents.The idea basically is that the users log in with their twitter account, getting slides of photos of other parents who use this service and liking them based on the location,the number of children and their ages. Parents who like each other are matched so they can communicate and meet at their own convenience.
